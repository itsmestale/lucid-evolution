=== Commits

+ fix typebox portable type annonation

#v(25pt)

=== Purpose 

This PR introduces a critical fix for type annotation in TypeScript configurations. The main objective is to resolve an issue where the TypeScript compiler could not name the inferred type of 'CredentialSchema' without a reference to a specific module in node_modules. This problem impacts portability and can hinder the deployment of the project across different environments.

#pagebreak()
#v(25pt)
=== Technical Changes
#v(25pt)
```ts
export const CredentialSchema = Data.Enum([
  Data.Object({
    PublicKeyCredential: Data.Tuple([
      Data.Bytes({ minLength: 28, maxLength: 28 }),
    ]),
  }),
  Data.Object({
    ScriptCredential: Data.Tuple([
      Data.Bytes({ minLength: 28, maxLength: 28 }),
    ]),
  }),
]);
export type Credential = Data.Static<typeof CredentialSchema>;
export const Credential = CredentialSchema as unknown as Credential;
```

=== Issue addressed
#v(25pt)
The patch fixes an issue with non-portable type annotations that arise due to the inferred type references, which are essential for project deployments that require explicit type declarations as part of their TypeScript configuration.

== Wallet from seed should query both base and enterprise addresses on signing

=== Commits

+  Wallet from seed should query both base and enterprise addresses on signing

#v(25pt)

=== Purpose 

PR #217 addresses a critical issue in the transaction signing process when using wallets derived from seeds. The problem stems from the library's method of querying UTXOs. Currently, the library only queries by base address, ignoring the payment credential. This results in the library refusing to sign transactions even when the user holds valid signing authority, leading to transaction failures.

#pagebreak()
#v(25pt)
=== Technical Changes
#v(25pt)
```ts
const utxos = await this.utxosAt(address);
```
This line of code is crucial as it is responsible for fetching UTXO data which is necessary for signing transactions. The issue was identified during the signTx call, where the function failed to correctly query UTXOs based on the payment credential.

=== Issue addressed
#v(25pt)
The specific bug involves the incorrect assumption that the addressType is unset, which leads to querying by base address rather than by the more specific payment credential. This misalignment causes valid signers to be unrecognized by the system during transaction signing, as showcased in the reproduction case provided.

=== Reproduction Case and Error
#v(25pt)
Transaction Details (from cardano-cli on preview testnet):

Inputs, outputs, and other transaction details reflecting the specific addresses and amounts affected.

Error Thrown: ShelleyTxValidationError related to missing VKey witnesses, indicating a failure in the authentication of transactions due to the incorrect UTXO query logic.

=== Commits

+ *Initial Commit (1f423e4):* Initial draft of Hydra provider
+ *Subsequent Update (767777b):* Minor bugfix and cleanup in Hydra provider

#v(25pt)

=== Purpose 

This PR introduces a prototype for a Hydra provider, which is aimed at enhancing interactions with the Hydra node directly from the browser. The prototype addresses issues related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and the management of UTXO sets within a browser environment.


#v(25pt)
=== Technical Changes
#v(25pt)
The provider is designed to retrieve the entire UTXO set from the Hydra node, which could be a significant change depending on the application's requirements and the size of the data involved.
It incorporates a solution for enabling CORS when calling from the browser, which is crucial for web-based applications interfacing with blockchain networks.

=== Purpose 
PR #219 introduces the Koios Provider to the Lucid library, enhancing the library's capabilities by integrating with the Koios API. This provider enables the Lucid library to fetch blockchain data through the Koios service, supporting various network environments such as Mainnet, Preview, and Preprod.

=== Technical Changes

The Koios Provider class implements the Provider interface, handling data retrieval from the Koios API.It includes methods for fetching protocol parameters, UTXOs by address or credential, and specific UTXOs by unit or output reference. The provider handles network-specific configurations and error management, aiming to streamline interactions with the Cardano blockchain through Koios.

+ feat: chaining of txs

=== Purpose 
PR #231 introduces a feature to enable chaining of transactions directly via the API. This new functionality allows transactions to be seamlessly linked, where outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs for subsequent transactions. 

This enhancement is particularly useful in complex transaction scenarios where multiple, dependent transactions need to be processed in sequence

=== Technical Changes

The addition of a chain method to the transaction API which facilitates the selection and use of transaction outputs as inputs for another transaction.
The inclusion of a test case to demonstrate and verify the chaining functionality
